# api_nodejs
A sample api which is intended to serve as base for doing other apps
# Node modules used:
- Express
- Morgan
- Body-Parser
- Underscore
- Nodemon
# Future
Possibly, there's a new feature to be included is to get an api petition from another api petition, like asking a web page a list of users outside our own database. For that feature to be possible, a node module called node-fetch should be used
